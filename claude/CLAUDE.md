# Agent Teams

Suggest using agent teams when a task has clearly independent workstreams that benefit from parallel exploration — e.g. research from multiple angles, parallel implementation of separate modules, or debugging with competing hypotheses. Don't suggest them for sequential tasks or simple single-file changes.

# Commit Messages

- Keep the subject line under 50 characters and describe what changed
- Use imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the commit body to explain why the change was made
