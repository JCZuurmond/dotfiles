# CI Practice

Integrate frequently with the main branch and remote branches. Keep branches short-lived and merge into mainline at least once a day. Pull from main and remote branches often to detect conflicts early while they are still small and easy to resolve.

# Commit Messages

- Keep the subject line under 50 characters and describe what changed
- Use imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the commit body to explain why the change was made
